# Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree

The projects in this program helps to enhance existing machine learning and deep learning skills with the addition of computer vision theory and programming techniques. In this program, I have learnt to:
* extract important features from image data, and apply deep learning techniques to classification tasks.
* use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.
* combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a deep learning model that produces captions given an input image.
* use feature detection and keypoint descriptors to build a map of the environment with SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping).
